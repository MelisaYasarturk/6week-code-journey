💬 Notes

Use === instead of == for stricter and safer comparisons (checks both value and type).
alert() is useful for quick browser messages but not commonly used in production code.
String methods are essential for manipulating and analyzing text data.
Template literals make string construction cleaner and easier to read compared to using +.
Arrays allow storing multiple values in a single variable, and provide helpful methods for managing lists.
