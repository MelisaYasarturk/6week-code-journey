This repository documents a habit-building challenge Iâ€™m undertaking as part of the Software Engineering course. The goal is to contribute to GitHub every weekday over a 6-week period, focusing on improving web development skills and creating valuable portfolio content.

  Build a consistent coding habit
  Enhance Git/GitHub usage and documentation practices
  Contribute to one or more personal or educational projects
  Make meaningful progress in web development

What I'm Working On

During this challenge, I aim to improve my web development skills by following online courses and building small CRUD projects.

Notes

This project is not only a course assignment but also a commitment to my own learning. By the end of this challenge, I aim to have both a solid coding habit and visible progress on GitHub that contributes to my portfolio.
